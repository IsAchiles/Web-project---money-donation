# Donate Money project for NGOs and charity purpose.

  This is a college project, which was design because we found a issue when trying to donate money for NGOs and charity instituions. The problem is that almost nobody takes money with anymore. People don't feel like getting out with cash money and the technology is helping us getting more confortable and feel save with new payment ways. So, we usually use our debit card to buy things or even our phone. However, NGOs often don't have this technology available.

  The purpose is to create a host website that act with payment ways for NGOs.
