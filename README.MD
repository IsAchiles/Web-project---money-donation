## Purpose

  Donate Money project for NGOs and charity purpose.

  This is a college project, which was design because we found a issue when trying to donate money for NGOs and charity instituions. The problem is that almost nobody takes money with anymore. People don't feel like getting out with cash money and the technology is helping us getting more confortable and feel save with new payment ways. So, we usually use our debit card to buy things or even our phone. However, NGOs often don't have this technology available.

  The purpose is to create a host website that act with payment ways for NGOs.

## :black_nib: Project resume
  We used the mvc design pattern, because it was the best option to define the project entities and organize the methods.On the backend, nodejs was implemented as a server base tool and we used the knex.js framework for SLQ and database connections, providing a easier way to use the "ISUD" methods. Furthermore, as a payment way, we configured the mercadoPago api, using the sandbox mode to simulate some transactions and test the application.
  
 So, to set up the connection between the website and the server, we've created a simple api with axios and we used it to call the controllers by http requests.
 
 The webpage design was done using figma, which is a good interface design tool. In advance to get in touch with the community trends, we used reactjs to develop the whole interface, using hooks instead of creating react classes. As consequence, the team performance was amazing and we could finish it faster than imagined.
